# Number-Array-Sorter
Simple C++ project that sorts a given array in ascending order.

Running main.cpp, the program first prompts you to enter a number between 1 and 100 (inclusive)
This number will serve as the length of the array.

After entering acceptable input, the program will prompt you to enter all the numbers to fill in the array.
These will serve as the elements in the array. Type in each one and press enter.
The order the numbers are entered in, is the order they will be placed in the array.

The program then prints out the array you have created, following that with the array after being sorted in ascending order.
